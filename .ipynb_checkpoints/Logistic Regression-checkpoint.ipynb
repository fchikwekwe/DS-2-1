    "#### - R squared can help to determine correlation and we can also use p values to determine confidence \n",
    "#### - Normal regression can use a single feature to predict a target value \n",
    "#### - Multiple regression uses multiple features to predict a single target value \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Logistical regression predicts things that are true or false instead of continuous (e.g. obese vs not obese instead of weight and size)\n",
    "#### - Logistical regression is usually used for classification; we can also use use continuous data and discrete data as well an involving multiple features\n",
    "#### - We can use Wald's Test to determine if features are helpful for determining our target (if its effect is significantly different than zero) \n",
